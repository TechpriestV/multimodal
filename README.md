Project for DT2140  Multimodal Interaction and Interfaces
Just using this as a notepad for now

## Whats needed:

### Scripts
* Ball logic: Ball behaviour, collision handling, curve?, alternating speed?
* Game logic: Keeping track of and incrementing score, win condition, updates UI
* Player paddle control: User input -> motion of paddle, raycast (from touch or constant ray from screen?)
* Computer paddle control: Basic AI, chasing ball coordinates

### Objects
* ARKit stuff: Camera, ARcameramanager and so on
* Ball: Texture? Glow? Basic colour?
* Boundaries: Walls basically. Collision handling
* Paddles: Smaller moving walls

### UI
* Scoreboard
* Ruleset?
* Winner announcement 

### Other
* Sound- scripts and object
